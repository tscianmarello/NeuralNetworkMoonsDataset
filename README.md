# NeuralNetworkMoonsDataset
This is a PyTorch Neural Network implementation to classify the make_moons function dataset created from sklearn. The program is split into the class portion of the program which contains the constructor (which linearly transforms the data), the forward function (which can be run with either the torch.tanh() or torch.sigmoid() functions), the predict function (containing the prediction function torch.nn.functional.log_softmax), the name function (returning the name of the model architecture), pred1 (used to map the decision boundary of the prediction), and the db function (which plots the dataset and the decision boundary).
The main function below creates the make_moons dataset, splits X and y into training and testing, converts X and y into tensors, detects GPUs and uses them if they are available, sets the learning rate, instantiates the MultiLayerPerceptron, sets the loss function (which can either be nn.CrossEntropyLoss() or MultiMarginLoss()), sets the optimizer, runs the neural network for loop (set for 1000 epochs), predicts the result based on the forward function passing this information to the loss_function where the current loss is then stored as a set of floats in a list, calculates the total loss, predicts the accuracy based on sklearn's accuracy_score metric, and plots the scatter plot with the decision boundary.
